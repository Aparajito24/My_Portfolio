PUT THE PHOTO IN A FOLDER NAMED "images"

SIMPLY DOWNLOAD THE DIFFERENT FILES OF HTML, CSS AND SCRIPT. MAKE A FOLDER IN WHICH YOU WANT TO KEEP THE PROJECT. CHECK THE NAMES OF THE FILES CAREFULLY. YOU CAN USE ANY GTEXT EDITOR OF YOUR CHOICE.

YOU CAN CONTACT OF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I DID.

HAPPY CODING!!
